twitter-harmattan (harmattan stock twitter client mod)
================

The stock twitter client in N9 is very bright white, which does not respect the battery usage on an AMOLED screen. To overcome this, the mod was made.

Most of the credits go to Coderus who succeeded in themeing the app as per plan and also has made the qml files available, possible to further edit as you wish.

Incept install the following deb file to replace stock client with new theme,

To use :: first incept install the deb file from dropbox link, then download my files and put(replace previous files) in /usr/share/twitter folder.

(qml files are avilable under /usr/share/twitter/qml)


Changes : Dark theme, loads of UI improvements, Better icons, (launcher iccons not improved yet), fixed timeline alwys jumping to beginning on page changes, added an option to "Quote retweet" on long press in tweet. It'd allow you to edit before retweet.
